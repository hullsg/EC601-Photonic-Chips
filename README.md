 EC601-Photonic-Chips
I am using the photonic integrated circuit simulator Simphony to construct components and circuits of photonic chips.  The simulator is being used under open source MIT License.

A conda environment was created for the Anaconda Python distribution using conda create -n Photon_test python=3.9.12 anaconda.  The environment is activated using conda activate Photon_test.

Simphony was installed into the environment using pip install simphony.
